## 🚀 About Karma Kart  
Karma Kart is a unique **service exchange platform**, much like Upwork or Fiverr, but without monetary transactions. Instead, users **trade skills and services**, ensuring fair exchanges through **Karma Points (KP)**, which are earned and used within the system. Whether you're a designer, developer, writer, or marketer, you can barter your expertise in return for the services you need.

### ✨ How It Works
1. **Post a Trade** – Describe the service you need and what you offer in return.
2. **Receive Requests** – Interested users can send requests to your trade.
3. **Chat & Negotiate** – Discuss the terms and refine the exchange.
4. **Accept & Set a Deadline** – Both parties confirm the trade with a fixed deadline.
5. **Complete the Work** – Deliver your part of the trade within the agreed timeframe.
6. **Earn & Use Karma Points** – Earn KP based on factors like demand, timeliness, and reliability. Use KP to access future services.
